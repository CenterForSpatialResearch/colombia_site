          <h1>RETRACING THE GEOGRAPHIES OF CONFLICT AND FORCED MIGRATION IN COLOMBIA</h1>
          <p class="text-center"><span style="color: white;">A COLLABORATION WITH THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</span></p>
          <p>In addition to covering almost the entire country, the geography of forced displacement
            reveals additional patterns of the conflict. Some of the cruelest moments in the history
            of the conflict occurred when different legal and illegal armed groups carried out massacres
            to instill terror in the civilian population. Understanding why forced displacement worsened
            during the 1990s requires explaining the flows of victims in the midst of this climate of
            abject terror. There are also cases of people who were forcibly displaced on several occasions
            and who have traveled to different areas of the country to protect their lives and that of
            their families. All these instances of displacement, explored in this visual project, are an
            essential part of the history of the victims and of the efforts that in the future can help
            rebuild the social fabrics torn by violence in Colombia.
          </p>
          <p>The following concepts are a result of our collaboration with the Truth Commission, who used our
            maps as part of their <a href="https://www.comisiondelaverdad.co/hay-futuro-si-hay-verdad">Final Report on the Conflict.</a>
            Their interrogation of our data and visualizations added spatial nuance to the documented history of violence and
            struggle in the Colombian conflict, and prompted us to look for additional variables - other forms of violence,
            multiple instances of victimization, time -  to understand the spatial effects of Human Rights’ violations in
            several regions of the country and to illustrate the local differences in forced displacement. We hope that by
            shedding light upon the localized nature of some cycles of violence, we can help regional peacebuilding efforts
            and reparations for the victims of the conflict.

              <p class="application-title"><span style="color: white;">THE SPATIAL LINK BETWEEN MASSACRES AND FORCED DISPLACEMENT</span></p>
              <p class="intro-bottom">All armed groups present in the country - guerrillas, paramilitary groups, drug traffickers, organized crime,
              and the Colombian Army and Police - contributed to the degradation of the conflict. One of the main mechanisms
              to instill terror and assert territorial dominance was the strategic use of massacres, events where multiple
              individuals were killed and their bodies often displayed to send political messages in a region.
              While paramilitary organizations, according to academic research, were the most prevalent group in committing massacres,
              they were not the only actors employing this practice.
              </p>
              <p class="intro-bottom">These massacres were also triggers of forced displacement. To investigate the specific nature of these flows,
              we created a timeline that links the occurrence of massacres, as documented by the National Center of Historical Memory,
              and the outgoing flows of victims of displacement.

              <p class="intro-bottom">Most available geographic information in Colombia is aggregated at the regional level, usually 
                following the administrative divisions of the country. Composed of 32 <i>departamentos,</i> Colombia is usually called a “country of regions.”
                This represents a methodological challenge, since these boundaries fail to capture the way in which people move, especially when escaping violence.
                While seeking refuge, victims of forced displacement are left with precious few options, including
                existing familial relationships and nearby towns or cities offering any sort of economic opportunity to rebuild.
              </p>
              <p class="intro-bottom">To better understand the regional dynamics of displacement, we used an algorithm to factor the relationship between
                all the municipalities in Colombia where forced displacement took place since 1985. The result is a series of (Louvain)
                communities, an approximate classification of these towns based on the links between them - that is, the volume
                and direction of outgoing victims of forced displacement.

              <p class="intro-bottom">The geography of forced displacement not only varies spatially but also has significant changes in temporality.
                To understand how the flows of victims ebbed and flowed as a result of the dynamic of war, we developed a spatiotemporal prism that turned
                the network of all municipalities in Colombia into a three-dimensional object that can be utilized to illustrate the mottled nature of
                forced displacement and the different roles that specific towns played during the history of the armed conflict.
              </p>
              <p class="intro-bottom">The prism shows how the humanitarian repercussions of the civil war shifted geographically with time,
                as the loci of the largest flows of displacement victims moved around different areas of the country.

              <p class="intro-bottom">In an attempt of mixing multiple and overlapping scales of analysis, we also focused on the recurrence of victims
                who endured forced displacement. Approximately 185,000 individuals (a little over 2% of all recorded victims in the
                Unified Victims Registry) registered more than one instance of displacement in the course of the conflict,
                and we have been sampling and plotting them to illustrate how local, regional, and national scales interact.
              </p>
              <p class="intro-bottom">We approached the recurrence of displacement through an animation that plots the movement of individuals
                who got their life upended on more than one occasion. The animation shows that, while some victims of displacement started a painful
                trek across the country to escape violence, others were committed to return to their territories.
