			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<p>Over the course of the last thirty years, almost 7 million Colombians
				have left their homes and towns in a search for safety.This mass migration,
				with its dense network of specific and often hyper-local
				causes, forms one part of the much larger global story of human beings on the
				move, mostly from countryside to city. But this movement of people also underlines
				the fact that the massive urbanization of the planet is born out of conflict.
				Behind this seemingly inevitable transformation lies battles of all sorts:
				military, political, social, economic, ethno-religious, imperial, and
				ecological.<br><br>
				In Colombia, the armed conflict, if not the movement, might be nearing its end.
				After more than three years of negotiations between the government and the FARC
				- and following a controversial demobilization process by the paramilitaries in 2005
				- the two parties have finally signed a historic peace accord. In this project we
				plot the trajectories of these Colombians in conflict, thanks to one dataset:
				the <a href="http://rni.unidadvictimas.gov.co/RUV">
          Registro Único de Víctimas</a>, a massive project undertaken by the Unidad para
				la Atención y Reparación Integral a las Víctimas as part of an effort to allocate
				reparations in the peace-building process.<br><br>
				As of May 1, 2016, 8 million Colombians were registered in the database and more
				than 6.2 million of them were "subjects of aid and reparation." The data reflects
				their stories - not simply the ones that will lead to aid, but the thick, complicated
				and often contradictory narratives of an extended and multi-sided conflict, an
				archive of the memories of millions of people. How has this war affected cities?
				And how has the conflict played out in the countryside? How have cities - small,
				medium and large - coped with these massive influxes of displaced people? Can
				spatial analysis - indeed spatial memory - figure into discourses of cultural and
				historical memory? And what relationships can we discover between land use and
				conflict or the built environment and war?<br><br>
				Government agencies have led data collection efforts designed to inform policy;
				cultural and civic groups have led extensive efforts to document cultural and
				historical memory with the intention of furthering transitional justice. Our
				work is situated between these two realms: it introduces spatial memory into the
				discourse of transitional justice, and provides insights that might inform
				nuanced transitional justice policies that are responsive to local needs and
				cognizant of socio-spatial phenomena.</p>
			<h2>INTERACTIVE MAP</h2>
      <p>Our interactive map shows the paths of internally displaced people from 1985 to 2015.
      The thickness of the lines represent the number of people that were displaced, from 100 to 40,0000,
      and the colors represent the direction of the displacement, white is the origin and orange the destination.<br><br>
      You can also click on some of the municipalities to see only the displacements to and from that
      location, and to bring up a side panel with more information. This panel contains a satellite
      image of the selected municipality (courtesy of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and U.S. Geological Survey),
      the latest population data from the Colombian National Department of Statistics (DANE), the total number
      of displaced people that left that municipality, the total number of displaced people that arrived to that
      location, and the total number of people that were displaced within that municipality.

She is the author of Close Up at a Distance: Mapping, Technology, and Politics (Zone Books, 2013). Her work explores things ranging from digital mapping technologies to the ethics and politics of mapping, and the art, science and visualization of data.</p>
			<p><a href="http://juanfrans.com/">Juan Francisco Saldarriaga</a> is an Associate Research Scholar at the Center for Spatial Research at Columbia University and an adjunct assistant professor of urban planning and architecture at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP). He does research at the intersection of data, GIS, urbanism, architecture and the humanities and teaches graduate level seminars on mapping, advanced GIS and data visualization.</p>
			<p><u>Angelika Rettberg</u> is an associate professor at the Political Science Department at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, where she leads the Research Program on Armed Conflict and Peacebuilding and the M.A. Program on Peacebuilding. Her research has focused on several aspects of the political economy of armed conflict and peacebuilding, such as the relationship between legal resources, armed conflict, and criminality in several Colombian regions, the dynamics of transitional justice, and business behavior in contexts of armed conflict and peacebuilding.</p>
